          <h2> Father of the Nation of Nepal.</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Late Shree Paanch Bada Maharajadhiraj Prithvi Narayan Shah Dev</b> (1723-1775). <br> Prithvi Narayan Shah
            was born prematurely on 7th January, 1723 as the first child of <i>Nara Bhupal Shah </i> and <i>
              Kaushalyavati Devi</i> in the Gorkha Palace. (Nepali: श्री ५ बडामहाराजाधिराज पृथ्वीनारायण शाह देव) was the
            last ruler of the Gorkha Kingdom and first monarch of the Kingdom of Nepal (also called Kingdom of Gorkha).
            <br> <br>

            Prithvi Narayan Shah started the unification of Nepal. Prithivi Narayan Shah proclaimed the newly unified
            Kingdom of Nepal as Asal Hindustan ("Real Land of Hindus") due to North India being ruled by the Islamic
            Mughal rulers. He also referred to the rest of Northern India as Mughlan (Country of Mughals). Prithvi
            Narayan Shah is also considered as the Father of the Nation in Nepal.

          <h3>His Biographies:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Prithvi Narayan Shah, the son of King Narbhupal Shah and Queen Kausalyavati Devi was born on 27 Poush
              Thursday, 1779 BS in Gorkha. </li>
            <li> From his childhood, he was very brave, bright, intelligent, and hardworking. He was given the knowledge
              of Ramayana, Mahabharata, and later Sukraniti. He also excelled in archery, swordplay, and horse racing.
            </li>
            <li> His first marriage was to Princess Indra Kumari of Makwanpur.</li>
            <li> After Narbhupal Shah's death in 1799 BS, he became King of Gorkha at the age of 20. </li>
            <li> To realize Father Narbhupal's dream of unification, in 1800 B.S., under the leadership of Biraj Thapa
              Magar and Maheshwar Pant, they invaded Nuwakot. But, the Gorkhalis were defeated at Nuwakot.</li>
            <li> Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked Nuwakot for the second time in 1801 BS under the command of Kalu Pandey.
              As Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Nuwakot, he attacked Velkot. After the conquest of Nuwakot and Velkot,
              the Gorkhalis captured Lamidanda.</li>
            <li> In 1814 BS, Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked Kirtipur. There were 1,200 soldiers on the Gorkha side. But
              when Kirtipur called for help from Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur, there were about 300 troops on the
              Kirtipur side. After a six-hour battle between the two sides on the Balkhu River, many Gorkhalis lost
              their lives. </li>
            <li> Prithvi Narayan Shah, who was captured in Kirtipur, survived only due to the moral rule of not killing
              the king. Kazi Kalu Pandey, who had died in the first battle of Kirtipur, was replaced by his son Vanshraj
              Pandey and Kehar Singh Basnyat, son of Shivram Singh Basnyat. In 1816 BS, he conquered Shivpuri and Kavre.
            </li>
            <li> In Bhadra 1819 BS, a large number of troops were sent by Banshrajpade and Kehar Singh, as well as
              Mahoddam Kirti Shah, Dalmardan Shah, Shur Pratap Shah, Nandu Shah, and Daljit Shah, attacked Makwanpur.
              The battle lasted 10 hours and finally, Digvandhan Sen surrendered.</li>
            <li> In 1820 BS, a joint force of King Trivikram Sen of Tanahun, King Mukunda Sen III of Palpa and King
              Siddhinarayan Shah of Kaski, in support of Digvandhan Sen, attacked and sacked Harmi, Bhirkot, Dhapkot,
              Chawangli, Dhaurali, and Lakankot under Gorkha's rule.</li>
            <li> In Bhadra 1821 BS, a second attack occurred in Kirtipur under the leadership of Shur Pratap Shah,
              Daljit Shah, and Shri Harsh Pant. Even in this war, Kirtipur did not receive military support from the
              valley as before, but the people of Kirtipur did not allow the Gurkha soldiers to break through the Gopura
              fort and enter Kirtipur. In this battle, Shur Pratap lost his sight and some other troops were forced to
              return.</li>
            <li> The third battle over Kirtipur was led by Kazi Vanshraj Pade. He surrounded Gopur fort on all sides and
              sent some soldiers to Kirtipur as farmers.</li>
            <li> In 1823, he married Ranbhim Shah, son of King Krishna Shah of Salyan, with their daughter Vilas Kumari.
              Chhilli, Dang, and Deukhari received as a dowry.</li>
            <li> During Indra Jatra on 13 Ashwin 1825 BS, Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Kantipur by invading Naradevi,
              Tudikhel, and Bhimsensthan from three sides.</li>
            <li> On Ashwin 25, 1825, Prithvi Narayan Shah sent Dhanwant and Kehar Singh to Lalitpur to surrender. The
              king of Patan fled without a fight.</li>
            <li> King Ranjit Malla sent 1,500 armed forces together with Vanshraj Pandey, Kahar Singh Basnyat, Ram
              Krishna Kunwar, Amar Singh Thapa, Kalidas Khadka, etc. .to attack Bhaktapur. There was a war in Bhaktapur
              in which great loss of life and property was caused.</li>
            <li> After retaining power in the three cities in the valley, Prithvi Narayan Shah set out to conquer
              twenty-four kingdoms in the west. In 1828, an army led by Vanshraj Pandey and Kehar Singh Basnyat was
              dispatched among the combined forces of the twenty-four states. In 1828, a fierce battle took place.
              During the 16-hour battle, more than 500 Gorkhalis, including Kehar Singh Basnyat, were killed and
              generals like Vanshraj Pandey and Prabhu Malla fell into enemy hands</li>
            <li> Prithvi Narayan Shah, who had gone to Nuwakot in mid-Mangsir, 1831 BS to avoid winter, fell ill at
              Nuwakot Durbar. As his health deteriorated, he was taken to Devighat. He remained on the dock for nine
              days and died at 7 a.m. on January 20. It is also mentioned that he died after being seriously injured in
              a tiger attack while out hunting. </li>
